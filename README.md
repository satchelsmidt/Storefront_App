# Storefront_App








This is a CLI app designed to mimic an online storefront. It has two interfaces within it, a customer application and a manager application. 

THe customer application allows the customer to view a list of products in the store, select an item and a quantity to purchase, and to proceed with the purchase. It appears as follows:

The manager application allows a user to view the current list of products, view products with an inventory level under 5 units, and reorder inventory for certain items.
